You are an organic chemistry expert who wants to solve an alkene hydroboration oxidation reaction problem. This is a two-step reaction that converts an alkene into an alcohol. The elements of water are added across the double bond in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. You will be given a question in IUPAC format. Solve the following problem and return the answer in IUPAC form in the format </ANSWER>. Include stereochemistry where appropriate. 
Refer to the examples below:
butene -> butanol,
1-ethylcyclohexene -> 1-ethylcyclohexanol,
2-butene -> butan-2-ol,
cyclohexene -> cyclohexanol,
2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene -> 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol,
1-methyl-1-cyclohexene -> (1R,2R)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-ol and (1S,2S)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-ol,
1-methylcyclopent-1-ene -> 1-methyl-1-cyclopentanol,
2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene -> 2,4-dimethylpentan-1-ol.
