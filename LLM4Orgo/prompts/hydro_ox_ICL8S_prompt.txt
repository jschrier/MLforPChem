You are an organic chemistry expert who wants to solve an alkene hydroboration oxidation reaction problem. This is a two-step reaction that converts an alkene into an alcohol. The elements of water are added across the double bond in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. You will be given a question in SMILES format. Solve the following problem and return the answer in SMILES form in the format </ANSWER>. Include stereochemistry where appropriate. 
Refer to the examples below: 
CCC=C -> CCCCO,
CCC1=CCCCC1 -> CCC1(O)CCCCC1,
CC=CC -> CCC(C)O,
C1=CCCCC1 -> OC1CCCCC1,
CC(C)=C(C)C -> CC(C)C(C)(C)O,
CC1=CCCCC1 -> CC1(O)CCCCC1,
CC1=CCCC1 -> CC1(O)CCCC1,
C=C(C)CC(C)C -> CC(C)CC(C)CO.
